This one is a little less technical.

I have the tendency to just put my head down
and work on stuff without every reflecting on where I have been or where I am
going. Six months ago I stumbled across Matt Swanson's developer
[year-in-review post](http://swanson.github.com/blog/2011/12/26/one-developer-year-in-review-2011.html)
and promptly set a Google alert for six months in the future to remind me
to do my own. Progress comes gradually, and I lose track of that if I don't look
back.


## Professional

For the first four months of the year I was at [SpotterRF](http://spotterrf.com)
, a startup that is doing awesome hardware stuff while dragging the military
kicking and screaming to modern web technologies.

We used lots of node.js internally, and dealt a lot with JSON apis. The company
was just coming off of a heavy period of research, and I spent a few weeks
working on testing, cleanup and refactoring.

I also spent a few months working with Google maps and mapping in general to
develop a photo underlay for a sensor product. I created the basic prototype
which is now being used in production. I also know more about
[Mercator projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) than
I ever thought possible.

In April I started a new job at [i.tv](http://i.tv), a startup that is trying
to change how we watch TV. I had played with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)
before, but I dove in to it full-time while there. I am a generalist, but I
lean more towards back-end stuff than front-end, so it was nice to play more
with client-side stuff.

I also led some testing efforts at i.tv. It got quite elaborate, since we use
lots of layers of services, but I learned lots about mocking and the benefits
that [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) bring to
designs.

I have spent the last few weeks working on a video-capture project, which
involves lots of Linux configuration and administration, along with development
of some new services.

The biggest change has not been in my technical skills or knowledge, but how I
approach problems. There is no way to say this without sounding clich√©, but i.tv
approaches problems assuming they can be solved. The relentless optimism has
rubbed off on me. It isn't cocky, but it is just a realization that people
have done lots of hard things in novel situations and we probably can too.


## Personal

It has been a pretty big six months. I don't know how to write about this
stuff without sounding cocky, so I'll just list stuff. Also, one of these is
not true. Guess which one.

* Presented at the [local JS group](http://utahjs.com)
* Spoke at my [first conference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix6IW7F3sps) on
  machine learning in JavaScript
* Created [baconsembly](http://baconsembly.com), a programming language where
  you encode instructions by laying strips of bacon on a frying pan
* Finished a research project on natural language processing that I still need
  to blog about
* Joined the [JavaScript Jabber](http://jsjabber.com) podcast
* Started the [Papers in CS](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/papers-in-computer-science)
  reading group, which you should all go join


## The Future

The next six months will be eventful. We are announcing and launching
a huge product which should bring all kinds of scaling challenges. There are
a few more conferences I'm planning on submitting proposals for. The Papers in
CS group should keep expanding. I want to play more with physical computing
and robotics. The next post in this series will be exciting.
