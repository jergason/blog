Eric S. Raymond [famously
said](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html),
“Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal
itch.” Some people itch more than others. Some people think problems
situations to be accommodated. If they sit on an uncomfortable chair,
they are uncomfortable. Other people tear down the chair, discover that
it is fundamentally flawed, and create a new chair. Being itchy means
evaluating the world instead of taking it for granted. It means creating
solutions instead of workarounds. Being itchy means progress.
