More blogging as remembering stuff. If you want to convert a Vim buffer
to HTML, syntax highlighting and color theme and all, use this command:

    :TOhtml

It opens a new buffer full of HTML that will look pretty much like your
Vim window when opened in a browser. Warning, this will include line
numbers and other weird things, so you might have to tweak Vim if you
want to make copy-paste friendly code.
