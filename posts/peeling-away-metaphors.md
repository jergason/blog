An electron is like a little ball orbiting a bigger ball - only it’s
not. A pointer is basically an address, and dereferencing it is like
finding the mailbox for that address - only it isn’t. We rely on
metaphors to teach broad principles about complex subjects. However, the
metaphor is not the truth. It is not what the thing actually *is*. As
you learn more, the metaphor creaks under the weight of fact. Little
things don’t make sense. Eventually, the metaphor falls away, revealing
true understanding. Real learning happens when you strip away the
metaphors to find more knowledge underneath. Sometimes another metaphor
awaits, and the process begins again.
