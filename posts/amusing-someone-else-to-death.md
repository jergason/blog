Neil Postman said, “[culture pays a price for
technology](http://www.mat.upm.es/~jcm/neil-postman--five-things.html "Neil Postman"),”
and that “technology favors some people and harms others.” Globalization
allows us to pretend this is not so. Really, we export much of the harm
to other countries. In this week’s [This American
Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory "Mr Daisey and the Apple Factory") Mike
Daisey describes the mammoth Foxconn factories where iPhones are
carefully pieced together by hand. Tens of thousands of Chinese laborers
work 14 hour days in huge industrial complexes so I can look at pictures
of cats on the internet anywhere I want. The technology that allows the
creation of such a small and powerful computer is amazing, but the
economies of scale that make it affordable are terrifying when viewed up
close.
