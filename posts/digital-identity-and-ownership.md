Who owns a digital identity? In the real world, a name does not uniquely
identify someone. We are happy to share the same name with someone else.
On the web, our pseudonyms generally need to be unique within whatever
service we are using. This can cause [conflicts](, and they are
difficult to resolve. What if there are several people that want to use
jergason as a nickname online? I was there first, but is that the only
way to decide? What if there is a company named jergason? Do they have
more of a right to the name than I do? One solution is some kind of
centralized internet ID that uniquely identifies everyone, with each
service pointing back to the ID. That seems a little Orwellian. Any
ideas for a better solution?
