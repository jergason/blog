There is an interesting discussion on Hacker News right now about using
tech skills to do something meaningful. One strategy is just to use your
skills to make money, and give some to charities.

I like that idea, and I think it even applies more generally than doing
volunteer work or giving to charity. Putting off doing something
important to you until your circumstances change is a good way to never
do it. I know I struggle with this a lot. Good advice in general.
