The TSA is a bungling bureaucracy whose main purpose is to justify their
own existence. They are a budget looking for a purpose. [The
latest](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/01/possibly_the_mo.html)
in a series of incidents demonstrates their uselessness as a security
organization. They
[have](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_shoe_bomb_plot)
[failed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab) to stop
any real threats. The reward for failure appears to be an expansion of
power. They have moved beyond airports, and are now [conducting roving
inspections](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/20/nation/la-na-terror-checkpoints-20111220)
of trains, busses and highways. This expansion of their mission when
they have been so useless at airport security is dangerous and wrong.
For [\$8.1
billion](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:sr396.110.pdf)
a year, they inconvenience and humiliate millions of passengers, and put
on a great show of security with no increase in safety.
