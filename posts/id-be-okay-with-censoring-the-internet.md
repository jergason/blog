I was talking with some non-techies on the day of the Great Blackout
about SOPA. Most of them had never heard of it before. One woman said,
“I would be okay with censoring the Internet.” I don’t understand what
kind of thinking could lead someone to say this. Does she imagine that
“censor the internet” means “removing stuff that I think is bad”?
Doesn’t she understand that she doesn’t get to choose what is censored
and what isn’t? I would love to talk to someone who has thought deeply
about SOPA and censorship in general and is in favor of it, because I
just cannot understand that viewpoint. It seems like the only pro-SOPA
people are the RIAA and the uninformed.
