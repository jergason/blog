I recently wrote a post talking about the
[sorry state of client-side code sharing](/browser-code-sharing-is-terribad),
and finished with a list of package managers for the browser. They all approach

them to see how it was to work with them.

I wanted to create a project using published modules, and publish a module to
each of these services to see how they compare.
