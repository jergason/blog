I am a software developer living in Utah and working at [i.tv](http://i.tv).
I don't write about myself in the third person. I tell tall tales of developer
legends from a simpler time. I am trying to make computers smarter than I am,
which may not be very difficult.

I work mostly in JavaScript, and these days am playing mostly in Go.

I am one of the co-hosts of the [JavaScript Jabber](http://jsjabber.com)
podcast, a weekly developer round table about projects and topics in (surprise)
JavaScript.

Find me on twitter at [@jergason](http://twitter.com/jergason) or
