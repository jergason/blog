I am a software developer living in Utah and working at [i.tv](http://i.tv).
I don't write about myself in the third person. I tell tall tales of developer
legends from a simpler time. I am trying to make computers smarter than I am,
which may not be very difficult.

I work mostly in JavaScript, and these days am playing mostly in Go.

Find me on twitter at [@jergason](http://twitter.com/jergason) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/jergason).
