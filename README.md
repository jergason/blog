My blog, based off of the [ruhoh](https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb.git) static
site engine.


## Installing Dependencies

```bash
gem install ruhoh
```

## Testing

See the site in action without compiling things with:

```bash
rackup
```

## Compilation

```bash
ruhoh compile
```

## Deployment

TODO: set up a git hook that installs the blog upon pushing.
